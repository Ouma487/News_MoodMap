# 🌍 Global News MoodMap with BigQuery AI  

Turn the overwhelming flood of global news into an **interactive world sentiment dashboard**.  
This project was built for the **BigQuery AI Hackathon 2025** and showcases how to combine **BigQuery + Generative AI + Vector Search** into a single workflow.  

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
Global news streams are massive, fragmented, and hard to interpret.  
The **Global News MoodMap** solves this by:  
- **Summarizing** daily news per country with LLMs.  
- **Scoring sentiment** with a blend of GDELT tone + AI analysis.  
- **Finding historical analogs** via vector search.  
- **Visualizing mood** on an interactive choropleth map.  

👉 In one click, decision-makers can see **what happened, why it matters, and how sentiment is shifting worldwide.**

## 🛠️ Workflow  

### 1. Ingest GDELT data  
- `gdelt_events_raw`: GDELT 2.0 events (60 days).  
- `gdelt_events_enriched`: joined with GKG → adds themes, people, orgs.  

### 2. Aggregate daily country docs  
- `daily_country_topics`: one row per `(country, day)` with headline count, tone, top events, and a compact `topic_doc`.  

### 3. Semantic embeddings + search  
- `news_embeddings`: Gemini embeddings for each topic doc.  
- `fn_similar_to_text(query)` → search by meaning (*“wildfires Spain”* for example).  
- `fn_similar_to_day(country, day)` → retrieve historical analogs.  

### 4. AI-generated briefings  
- `daily_briefings`: structured summaries with 4 sections:  
  - *What happened*  
  - *Key drivers*  
  - *Impact*  
  - *What to watch next*  
- Enriched with **historical analogs**.  

### 5. Mood scoring + visualization  
- `daily_moodmap`: combines AI sentiment + GDELT tone.  
- Interactive **Plotly choropleth** with hover summaries.

## 📊 Demo Highlights  
- 🌍 **Interactive MoodMap** → countries colored by mood (😡 → 😃).  
- 🔎 **Semantic search** → find related events without keywords.  
- ⏳ **Historical analogs** → discover similar past situations.

## ⚖️ Notes
- For cost efficiency, AI briefings + moodmap were generated only for the latest day (top N countries).
- Pipeline generalizes to multiple days with the same queries.
- This was my first hands-on project with BigQuery AI, the goal was to learn fast while building something impactful.

## 📌 Next Steps

1. Extend to 14–30 days → richer temporal trends.

2. Scrape article URLs → enrich summaries with snippets.

3. Add regional & sector views.

4. Real-time dashboard (Streamlit / Looker).

5. Automated alerts for sharp sentiment shifts.
